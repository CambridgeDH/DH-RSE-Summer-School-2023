## Introduction

### 3D Data - Structure from Motion 

**Instructor**: Neil Jakeman

Structure from motion is an imaging technique for creating 3D images from 2D images. In this workshop we will cover 
how to image a variety of artefacts for humanities and collections research. We will look at strategies for different 
scenarios (e.g. [room scale capture](https://skfb.ly/oF9N6), [landscape capture](https://skfb.ly/o8ErV), and capturing 
[individual smaller items](https://skfb.ly/6SR8u) with differing textural qualities). We will consider how to 
systematically record the creation process for reproducibility and third-party critique. To explore the method we will 
use trial versions of Agisoft Metashape (30-day evaluation licence), which will allow us to see the technique in action.

**Pre-workshop preparations**: 

**Important** - do not install the trial software more than 30 days in advance of the workshop; your license will expire.
The software we will be using is available at [https://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/](https://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/)
and is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. Note that both Standard and Professional editions of Metashape allow to run
the fully functional trial from the Activate Product dialog without requesting a trial key (the option Start a free 30-day 
trial should be selected in the Activation dialog).

You might like to attempt scanning a personal item in 3D? If so, consider bringing an item which doesn't have a reflective surface
and exhibits enough surface texture for the software to identify distinct regions. Photogrammetry doesn't work as well
on reflective and metallic surfaces, or with transparent objects.

It is perfectly possible to use photos taken with a phone to generate models, however you will find a more flexible option is to use
a camera that can be easily configured for different exposure settings, such as a DLSR or mirrorless.

### Teaching Computational Methods to Humanities Researchers

**Instructors**: Lucia Michielin, Jessica Witte

Teaching computational methods to researchers from non-STEM backgrounds, such as those working in humanities disciplines 
that have not historically incorporated digital methods, presents unique challenges. During this workshop, we are going 
to explore several pedagogical methods for training humanities researchers on digital research techniques. We will 
discuss and demo different training modalities, including hands-on live coding workshops, how-to guides to approach 
methods, and asynchronous online options. We will also explore ideas for good practice in supporting humanities 
researchers in incorporating computational techniques into their existing research. We will do this by exploring 
different training activities focusing on the same technique to see how to set learning environments to better engage 
with various audiences, and how to bridge the gap between computer science and humanities methodologies. The workshop 
will focus on text analysis techniques and will use Python.
