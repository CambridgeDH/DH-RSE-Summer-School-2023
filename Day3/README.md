# Day 3: 27 July 2023, Cambridge, UK

## Introduction

### Collaborating on Code

**Trainers**: Levan Bokeria, Lydia France

Collaboratively writing and reviewing code is a crucial skill for working as part of a team. Keeping track of 
outstanding issues and proposed solutions, as well as ensuring compatibility of code written by different team members 
becomes challenging as the team size grows. In this hands-on workshop, we will review the "gitflow" framework for 
efficiently organising and tracking collaborative programming, and practice creating GitHub Issues, Git branches, and 
Pull Requests. A basic familiarity with Git and the GitHub interface is recommended.

### Testing and Continuous Integration

**Trainer**: Mary Chester-Kadwell

Testing code helps to make sure it behaves the way we intended and continues to do so in the future. Writing code and 
tests together at the same time helps us to write modular and testable code. Running tests should be done every time 
code changes and whenever code is merged on collaborative projects, which is a task ideally suited for automation. In 
this workshop we will cover these topics, building on the collaborative coding exercise from the morning. The workshop 
will use Python and YAML.
